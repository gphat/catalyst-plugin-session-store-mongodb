NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Redis - The great new Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Redis!

SYNOPSIS

    use Catalyst qw/
        Session
        Session::Store::Redis
        Session::State::Foo
    /;
    
    MyApp->config->{session} = {
        expires => 3600,
        redis_server => '127.0.0.1:6379',
        redis_debug => 0 # or 1!
    };

    # ... in an action:
    $c->session->{foo} = 'bar'; # will be saved

DESCRIPTION

Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Redis is a session storage plugin for
Catalyst that uses the Redis key-value database.

NOTES

Expired Sessions

This store does B<not> automatically expire sessions.  You can call
C<delete_expired_sessions> to clear any expired sessions.  All sessions will
then be checked, one at a time.  If a session has expired then it will be
deleted.

WARNING

This module is currently untested, outside of the unit tests it ships with.
It will eventually be used with a busy site, but is currently unproven.
Patches are welcome!
